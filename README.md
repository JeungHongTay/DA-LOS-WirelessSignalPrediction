# UWB LOS/NLOS Signal Classification & Distance Estimation

## Overview

This repository contains the code and resources for a project aimed at predicting the Line-of-Sight (LOS) and Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) conditions of Ultra-Wideband (UWB) signals and estimating the distance of objects based on the given dataset. This project is part of the Data Analytics coursework at the University of Glasgow.

## Key Tasks:

Task 1: Develop a classification model to predict LOS/NLOS.

Task 2: Build a regression model to estimate distance for accurate localization.

## Steps to Run the Code

1. Clone the Repository

git clone <repository-url>

2. Install Dependencies

Ensure that you have the necessary Python libraries installed.
